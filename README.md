Currently Supported Auto Changer Version: 49e05c4106b541bf released on 2020.12.03


   NOTICE
  1. Every time roblox is updated, you need to execute RunMe.bat again. This is because the folder name where Roblox executable is located changes when it updates itself.
  2. Please check your Roblox version at C:\Users\(Your_User_Name)\AppData\Local\Roblox\Versions. The folder name would be like "version-49e05c4106b541bf." Keep in mind that what you need to check is the NEWEST folder's name. Older folder has nothing to do with this process.
  3. If your version is different from what "Supported Auto Process Version, Follow the instructions at part 3.


  How to use this?
  1. Download Package.zip and extract it.
  2. Get your new "2" fonts from the internet(Must be .TTF format) 
  3. Copy them to package folder you just extracted in step 1.
  4. Rname one as "Killfeed.ttf" (this will be applied for killfeed font) and the other as "UI.ttf." (this is for user interface.)
  5. Run Downloader.exe and wait for the process to end. Usually it takes about 30 seconds.


   My version is different from what this text shows! How can I fix that?
   
  Download changer file for your version, copy it to the directory where you put .ttf fonts and Run changer file. Make sure you have already changed the name of fonts before executing changer.
